    <ul>
        <li><strong>Spaghetti:</strong> This recipe, which makes about four servings, starts with one pound of uncooked spaghetti.</li>
        <li><strong>Oil:</strong> You’ll need ½ cup of olive oil. </li>
        <li><strong>Garlic:</strong> Six cloves of thinly sliced garlic lends bold flavor. </li>
        <li><strong>Seasoning:</strong> This traditional spaghetti aglio e olio is flavored with crushed red pepper flakes, black pepper, and fresh parsley. </li>
        <li><strong>Cheese:</strong> For the most delicious results, grate your own Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese instead of opting for the pre-shredded stuff. </li>      
    </ul>

    <h2>Notes </h2>
    <p>
        No two aglio e olio recipes are alike, but this one is pretty true to the classic method. The key is slowly toasting the garlic slices to a perfect golden brown in the olive oil. If it's too light, you don't get the full flavor and if it's too dark it gets bitter. My advice? Do it perfectly.
